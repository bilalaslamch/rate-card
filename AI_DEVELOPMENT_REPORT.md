# AI Development Report

## Tools Used
- **OpenAI GPT-4 (Cursor/Copilot):** For code generation, refactoring, and documentation.
- **@react-pdf/renderer:** For PDF generation.
- **SendGrid:** For transactional email delivery.
- **Supabase:** For database and data fetching.
- **React/Next.js:** For frontend and backend integration.

---

## Code Generation: Examples

**Custom React Hooks:**
```ts
export function useCustomResourceRates() {
  // Fetches rates from Supabase and returns data, loading, error
}
```

**Business Logic for SWAT Team Calculator:**
```ts
const calculateDiscountedRate = (workloadValue, durationValue) => {
  // Calculates base rate, applies workload percentage and duration discount
  // Returns final rate and breakdown
};
```

**PDF/Email Templates:**
```tsx
<Document>
  <Page>
    {/* Professional layout, branding, and dynamic data */}
  </Page>
</Document>
```

**API Integration:**
```ts
const response = await fetch("/api/email", { method: "POST", ... });
```

---

## Problem Solving
- **API/Hook Refactoring:** Migrated from API route-based data fetching to direct Supabase hooks, simplifying the frontend and improving performance.
- **PDF/Email Template Consistency:** Generated matching HTML and PDF templates, ensuring branding and data consistency.
- **Parameter Handling:** Updated the email endpoint to handle both calculator types with different data structures.

---

## Time Savings
- **Estimated 60-70% time saved** compared to manual development:
  - Hook and business logic scaffolding: minutes instead of hours.
  - PDF and email template generation: hours saved on layout and formatting.
  - API integration and error handling: rapid, reliable code blocks.

---

## Integration Assistance
- **API Endpoints:** Provided ready-to-use fetch logic and backend endpoint updates for SendGrid.
- **PDF/Email:** Generated both the React-PDF and HTML email templates, and integrated them with the frontend and backend.
- **UI/UX:** Created reusable modal and button components for user interaction.

---

## Business Logic
- **Custom Resource Calculator:** Fetches rates from Supabase, allows user selection, and displays the correct rate based on region, role, and seniority.
- **SWAT Team Calculator:** Applies workload percentages and duration-based discounts to a base rate, with all logic encapsulated in a custom hook for maintainability.

---

## Most Valuable Help
- **Rapid Prototyping:** The most significant value was in quickly generating and iterating on complex business logic, PDF/email templates, and integration code, allowing focus on business requirements and UX rather than boilerplate.
